    "The data analysis will be conducted using regression by the K-nearest neighbors algorithm. The predictive variable used will be the total floor area of each house, a significant feature buyers consider when looking at new properties. This will therefore be a helpful variable to use in the model, allowing one to predict the price based on how big a house is. \n",

    "During our analysis, we will use cross-validation to determine the ideal K value. In general, the K value should follow the overall trend in the training data, while steering clear of the fluctuations and variations in price. This will allow the model to transfer successfully to the new testing data and prevent over/underfitting. After determining the optimal K value, we will train the regression model on the training data set, make predictions on the test data, and compute the RMSPE to evaluate the model.\n",
